## About Me
I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).  
My interests lie in systems design, algorithms, and applied research bridging academic concepts with real-world development.

I am particularly engaged with topics such as Internet of Things (IoT), Opportunistic Networks (OppNets), and middleware interoperability.  
Alongside research, I actively participate in competitive programming and enjoy solving algorithmic problems that emphasize clarity and efficiency.
